Learning Goals
==============

* To introduce functions as a means of abstraction
* To introduce the concepts behind scope
* To learn to use functions as part of a top-down stepwise refinement development process
* To introduce unit testing

Objectives
==========

* To be able to identify formal parameters and actual parameters in a code sample
* To Write a unit test to cover all preconditions and postconditions of a problem statement
* To correctly predict the return value of a function given sample actual parameters
* Given a problem statement and a set of unittests write a function that passes all of the unittests
